To explain how this all works here:

The files located in this root are for legacy reasons. 
0.1 did not have this layout, so exist only to provide support for 0.1. 
This will be removed once 0.5 or above is released.

The files are organized by the version of TotalPermissions that they were made for. 
This allows different versions of these files for the different versions and for the future.
